# Custom BPFlow Nodes
By default, there are common nodes and custom nodes for the example flows: hot-cold, Tic-Tac-Toe, and PrestaShop. 

The custom nodes are defined at the [build-nodes.js](build-nodes.js) file. This file contains an array of InOutNode objects.

To See the definition of each InOutNode object, please refer to the the JSDoc of the InOutNode and the Field functions inside the [nodeGenerator.js](nodeGenerator.js) file.

## Development
The development of the custom nodes is still in progress. If you wish to add more customization options, please refer to the [Node-Red documentation](https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/). 

For example, currently, the possible field types are: text and select. Yet, Node-Red supports more types such as: multiple-select, JSON, and more. See https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/edit-dialog for more information.
